1) Change version in the following files :

   - pom.xml
 
   // - Version.java (no longer required, as it is based on "telosys-cli-build.properties", updated with each build)

   - build_dist.xml : only if there are changes other than version (version is set from "pom.xml")


2) Build Telosys CLI 


3) Test deployment and usage


4) Create a tag 

     On project : Team / Advanced / Tag...

     Tag name    : X.X.X-YYY    ( same version as in 'pom.xml' )

     Tag message : Version X.X.X-YYY
